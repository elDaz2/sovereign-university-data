  Our mission is to support local Bitcoin communities through open-source education and networking. We collect, organize, and create the necessary resources (courses, books, posters, flyers, videos) for the Bitcoin industry to advance. 
  
  We centralize knowledge to better distribute it through a simple, multilingual GitHub repository and an E-learning platform. We assist local Bitcoin hubs in their development with the right tools for their talent to grow.
