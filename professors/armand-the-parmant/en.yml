  My mission is to bring on hyperbitcoinisation as fast as possible. I believe it is inevitable anyway, but I want it to come sooner. Bitcoin is already good enough; what needs to change is peoples' acceptance. That comes with knowledge. And so, I do everything I can to spread the knowledge â€“ from the moment I wake up, to the moment I fall asleep, and then even in my sleep, I serve.
