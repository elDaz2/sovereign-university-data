  My name is QnA. I am a Bitcoiner and I like to help other Bitcoiners. I spend my days building Bitcoin-centric sovereignty tools at Foundation. This site is a collection of my contributions that I can point people towards to help them along their journey. If you find it valuable, please share it with your peers and consider contributing or sending a tip.
